# TD5 - RÃ©seaux de Neurones

In this simulation, a neural network is used to set the color of objects after being trained using back-propagation.

- Open the project in Unity. Click on the play button at the top center of the window, in order to start the simulation.

- Set the number of nodes per row (line), the number of columns for the input nodes, and the number of columns for the output nodes, with the sliders at the top of the screen. Then, click on the "Generate Nodes" button.

- The nodes have appeared: the input nodes as cubes (left), the desired output nodes as spheres (center), and the actual output nodes also as spheres (right).

- Click on any input and desired output nodes to activate them (yellow) or not (white). Then, click on the "Start Neural Network" button.

- Each actual output nodes color has now been set by the neural network. In the "Console" at the bottom of the screen, you can scroll though the different error values, as well as the exact values given by the neural network to all actual output nodes.

- At any time, you can click: on the "Clear Colors" button to set each nodes color to their default color: white, or on the "Reset Setup" button to delete all nodes from the screen.
