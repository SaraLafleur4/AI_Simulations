# TD4 - Algorithmes Génétiques

In this simulation, the initial population consists of cubes of random colors. Each cube has a DNA composed of 3 elements: a red value, a green value, and a blue value. The fitness of each cube refuses to the green value of its DNA. The higher the green value, the higher the chance that cube will be picked to be a parent for the next generation. Click on the "New Generation" button to generate the next generation.

- Open the project in Unity. Click on the play button at the top center of the window, in order to generate the first generation.
